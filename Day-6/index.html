                <h3>Paragraph About Afghanistan Carpet and Rugs:</h3>
                <p class="B1">Carpets of Afghanistan is without a doubt one of the most detailed analysis of Afghanistan
                    rug production ever published. Author Richard Parsons, for many years a buyer in Afghanistan for the
                    well-known firm O.C.M (London) Ltd, treats the reader not only to a veritable feast of carpets and
                    rugs, all with their attendant tribal origins and motifs vividly explained, but also to a
                    fascinating journey through the history of a diverse and colorful country. The author shares his
                    respect and admiration for Afghanistan's stoic people, who, somehow, despite political upheavals,
                    forced resettlement, a harsh climate and often primitive nomadic conditions, manage to fashion
                    exquisite works of art which reflect their pride in their many-faceted heritage. Afghan rugs, which
                    are instantly appealing due to their traditional colors and bold designs, open up a whole vista for
                    the collector, from sumptuous piled purdahs to flat woven prayer rugs, all of them well illustrated
                    in the 154 color and 90 black and white plates.
                </p> <br>
                <h3>Paragraph About men 's traditional dress in Afghanistan:</h3>
                <p class="B2">The perahan tunban is the standard traditional uniform dress for men, consisting of a
                    tunic shirt, pants, and with (optional) head covering. This dress originates from the Pashtun
                    lands but its use spread to most of Afghanistan. It remains the predominant dress for male
                    villagers. Some of the more famous varieties are the Kandahari Doozi and Herati Doozi styles. On
                    the head is normally a turban (lungi): they are worn all over the country, but the fabric, color
                    and style varies region by region. For example, an Uzbek hat from the north of the country is
                    distinct from a Pashtun hat worn in the south.

                    From a young age, boys often wear colorful caps with shiny "chips" of mirrors sewn into them.

                    The karakul hat is made of sheep fur and is of typical Central Asian style. Normally worn by the
                    more stylish or educated, these hats come in conservative colors. The chapan coat is another
                    cloth of Central Asian origin that provides warmth in the winter, made of striped silk. The
                    chapan gained international recognition in the 2000s when Afghan president Hamid Karzai always wore
                    a green one.
                </p> <br>
                <h3>Paragraph About women 's traditional dress in Afghanistan</h3>
                <p class="B3">Traditional women's dresses are always long and are made from light linens and are
                    loose fitting for ease of movement. They come in many colors and have stitching for details. Most
                    traditional clothing are colorful, except for the Nuristan dress.[1] More elaborate and fancier
                    dresses are detailed with gold threading (Zardozi), gold beads, and come in many different colors on
                    silk fabrics. These dresses are usually worn to special occasions and weddings.

                    They are usually of heavy design and filled with small mirrors around the chest area, along with
                    long and pleated skirts.

                    Most Afghans are Muslim and virtually all Afghan women wear a head covering based on the local
                    interpretation of religious laws. Most women wear a hijab or chador as a covering. Some wear a
                    chadari, better known in the West as burqa.

                    In a few places like Kabul, Western dresses like jeans are often worn. From the 1960s to 1990s, more
                    liberal forms of female dress like miniskirts were popular among some communities in Kabul.

                <h3>Information abount Afghanistan society:</h3>
                <p class="B4">Afghanistan is a landlocked south-central Asian country bordering Iran, Pakistan,
                    Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. It is a multi-ethnic society, containing diverse ethnic,
                    linguistic and tribal groups.

                    The government is an Islamic Republic and Islamic values, concepts and practices inform many social
                    and behavioral norms throughout society. Afghans generally have a strong sense of personal honor.
                    Hospitality, loyalty and modesty are highly valued. However, Afghan culture and daily life have been
                    significantly impacted by constant conflict. Resilience is now an essential trait that has become
                    instilled within the Afghan character as a result of these experiences.

                    While Afghanistan does have its own troubles, it's also an incredibly beautiful country that is full
                    of amazing people.</p>
